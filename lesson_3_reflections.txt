Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: To collaborate or share your work.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Someone else may have modified your code, or you may want to review the changes made online prior to pulling them locally.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks - Allow you to create a copy of a repo while still identifying the source.   Once code is forked, you cannot push changes back to the orininating repo.
Clones - Clones allow you to copy a repository from GitHub to your local git files, or they allow you to clone (make a copy) of a repo in your git account. 
Branches - Branches are divisions of code within a specific repo.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: You can use git diff on the local files to determine what has changed and then merge the branches.  In addition you can work offline.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: You could access the same files on a file server, a service like dropbox, or email files back and forth.  This would be much more difficult than using git or git hub as it would rely on each person to keep track of their changes and communicate them to the team.  In addition, all changes would need to be merged manually while Git or GitHub can do this all this for you.
