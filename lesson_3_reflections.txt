Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: To collaborate or share your work.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Someone else may have modified your code, or you may want to review the changes made online prior to pulling them locally.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks - Allow you to create a copy of a repo while still identifying the source.   Once code is forked, you cannot push changes back to the orininating repo.
Clones - Clones allow you to copy a repository from GitHub to your local git files, or they allow you to clone (make a copy) of a repo in your git account. 
Branches - Branches are divisions of code within a specific repo.
