Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A: It identified the lines in each file which were different when compared to each other.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: It will allow me to view how a file changes over time.  This can be useful if a bug or error is introduced as it will allow me to see what I've changed and to revert back to the prior version of a file if needed.  In addition, I may not like changes I have made to a file and wish to go back (revert) to a prior version.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
A: Pros -- You get to choose the scope of each committ and you aren't cluttering Git with uneccessary commits that don't represent significant changes in the code.  Cons: It is possible to forget to save commits at the appropriate times.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: Projects are often made of many related files and it is important to track them as a set as they depend on one another.  In the case of Google Docs, documets don't often directly depend on one another so tracking their changes as a set isn't necessary.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: Git log will show you all the commits (and Commit IDs).  You can then use Git Diff to compare two commits (using their IDs).

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A: Because I know I can always go back to a prior state (when it worked).

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A: I have several web-dev projects where I would like to track changes to HTML and CSS files.  In addition, I am learning to program in C and I want to use Git for tracking my projects.
